==============

This project is just for fun. Open index.html to see how it works.

Usage
-----

[Check this](http://kremer.pro/projects/marquee/#?text=GIT). This page is not optimized for mobile devices (you are not able to change the speed, all other things are all fine), I hope I'll fix it sometime. You can use CTRL+UP and CTRL+DOWN to change the speed in your desktop browser.
